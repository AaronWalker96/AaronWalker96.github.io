        <h2>Personal profile</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>I am currently a student studying Computer Science at Teesside University with a predicted 1st class degree.
        I have industry experience in the form of a placement year working as a software developer at Accenture. 
        My University modules have helped me develop strong problem solving skills as well as gaining significant 
        technical experience with different software and technologies. My previous work experience has equipped me with 
        an excellent attention to detail along with great organisational skills.</p>
        <h3>Skills and technologies</h3>
        <p>Some of the technologies I have worked with include: C#, Java, Python, SQL, UIPath (Robotics Process Automation), 
        NetLogo, Clojure, HTML, CSS and Git. I've built projects using: Visual Studio, Android Studio, Xcode and UIPath Studio.
        </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I did my A-Levels in graphic design and double award IT at Queen Elizabeth sixth form collage from 2013 to 2015. I then moved
        on to Teesside University to study Computer Science with a placement year from 2015 to 2019.
        </p>
