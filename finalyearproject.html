            <p>This is the first offical week working on the project! My goals for this week were to complete my initial project
                proposal. This was a document that outlined the project, what I was planning to complete, why it was important
                and identifying any ethical issues. In addition to this document, I wanted to start collecting my training data
                for the project.

        <p>To help prepare me to meet these goals, I’ve been researching into different machine learning technologies. 
            Some of the things I’ve done to prepare include reading a book recommended to me by my artificial intelligence 
            lecturer, “Deep Learning” (A. Courville, I. Goodfellow, and Y. Bengio, 2015). The book gives a great overview of 
            different deep learning techniques including most relevant to me, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The book 
            is available at the following link:</p><br>

        </div>

        <br><p>I have also been working on a simple neural network that predicts the valuation of second-hand cars based on 
        the age and mileage. This network wasn’t particularly accurate as there are many more variables to take into 
        account when valuing a second hand car, however the construction of this network taught me a great deal of how a 
        neural network functions and the maths behind them. The source code for this project can be found at the following GitHub repository:</p><br>

            <p>For my final year project, I want to expand my knowledge in an area of research that I am very interested in; 
                machine learning. Whilst on my placement year at Accenture, I got the opportunity to work on a machine learning 
                project using a logistic regression algorithm in order to categorise words and phrases, and this sparked my 
                passion to peruse a career in this area. I want to take the opportunity of my final year project to expand 
                my knowledge and to produce a piece of machine learning software that I can add to my portfolio.<br><br> The area 
                of machine learning I want to conduct my research in is neural networks. I have chosen neural networks as it’s 
                an area of machine learning I have little experience in, however it has a similar goal to the logistic regression 
                algorithm I have worked with in industry, meaning I already have a good foundation of knowledge on which to 
                build.</p>
