            <p>This was the first official week working on the project! My goal for this week: complete my project
                proposal. This was a document that outlined the project, why it was important, some research I had gathered, 
                what I was planning to build, and identifying any ethical issues. I also constructed a plan for the project 
                that included phases, sub tasks and deadlines. I made sure to factor in my other module deadlines.

        <p>To help prepare me to meet these goals, I’ve been researching into different machine learning technologies. 
            Some of the things I’ve done to prepare include reading a book recommended to me by my artificial intelligence 
            lecturer, “Deep Learning” (A. Courville, I. Goodfellow, and Y. Bengio, 2015). The book gives a great overview of 
            different deep learning techniques including most relevant to me, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The book 
            is available at the following link:</p><br>

        </div>

        <br><p>I have also been working on a simple neural network that predicts the valuation of second-hand cars based on 
        the age and mileage. This network wasn’t particularly accurate as there are many more variables to take into 
        account when valuing a second hand car, however the construction of this network taught me a great deal of how a 
        neural network functions and the maths behind them. The source code for this project can be found at the following GitHub repository:</p><br>

            <h2>12/2018</h2>
            <p>For my final year project, I want to expand my knowledge in an area of research that I am very interested in; 
                machine learning. Whilst on my placement year at Accenture, I got the opportunity to work on a machine learning 
                project using a logistic regression algorithm in order to categorise words and phrases, and this sparked my 
                passion to peruse a career in this area. I want to take the opportunity of my final year project to expand 
                my knowledge and to produce a piece of machine learning software that I can add to my portfolio. The application 
                of this technology will be used to classify the ages of people in provided images. <br><br> 

                Age classification of users has many possible applications such as: restricting access to inappropriate content 
                online, targeted advertising and even automated access to age restricted events and physical locations. <br><br> 

                I have chosen to implement this project using convolutional neural networks as it’s an area of machine learning 
                I have little experience in, however it has a similar goal to the logistic regression algorithm I have worked 
                with in industry, meaning I already have a good foundation of knowledge on which to build. <br><br> 

                I chose a project around facial recognition as it is easy to demonstrate, which will be useful as a portfolio 
                piece in job interviews. It will also be more engaging to demonstrate at ExpoTees where I can use my application 
                on potential employers.
